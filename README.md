This project is the outcome of a iOS app competition at the University of Hamburg. It's major goal is to improve and simplify the communication between doctors and patients. The system developed consists of three applications. This iPhone app addresses patients. Other apps that were developed are an iPad app developed for doctors and a Ruby on Rails backend application that handles the communication between these two.
Main features are creation and management of appointments and viewing of documents sent by the doctor.
